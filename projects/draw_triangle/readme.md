### Draw triangle  

First vulkan triangle!

### Validation layers:  
Validation layers can be used if they have been onto the system. For example, the LunarG validation layers are only available on PCs with the Vulkan SDK installed.  
The SDK allows you to request the `VK_LAYER_LUNARG_standard_validation` layer that implicitly enables a whole range of useful diagnostics layers.  
The `NDEBUG` macro is part of the C++ standard aand means not debug.
